# CRA-WIN - A Customized Robust Analysis Windows Forensics Environment Builder

## About CRA-WIN

The design behind this is to use a barebones Windows 10 machine or VM (preferably 1909 and higher to support WSLv2).  
Once configured, and activated (to support customization features), then you can use one of the installers [found here](https://github.com/digitalsleuth/crawin-salt) to install all of the packages.  
  
The Executable Command Line Installer simply need to be executed from an Administrator Command Prompt.  
The PowerShell install requires that the `Set-ExecutionPolicy` feature be set to allow the script to run, at least twice, depending on your choices. This is best left to you to decide what is acceptable in your organization.

For more details, check out the [Using the Installer](installation/using-the-installer.md) section.

For a listing of tools, check out the sub-sections from the menu on the left.
